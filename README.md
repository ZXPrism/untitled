A hobby **game** project start on 2024.07.21.

## Getting Started (Windows Only)
### Prerequisites
1. Install `xmake` from [xmake.io](https://xmake.io).
2. Add the path of `xmake` executable to your system environment variables.
3. Make sure your system have available C++ compilers (at least support **C++20** standard) installed and **have environment variables set properly**.

### Build
1. Clone this repository.
2. Under the repository's root folder, execute command `xmake` to build the project.
   - All dependencies will be automatically downloaded and compiled (if necessary) during this process.
   - Since these dependencies are downloaded from github, you may encounter some network issues. If so, use a VPN and try again.

### Test / Run
If you follow the instructions above and everything is fine, an executable named `untitled.exe` should appear in the folder `bin`, along with the folder `asset` containing game resources.

You can now launch the executable by double-clicking it.
